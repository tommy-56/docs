This document defines and describes certificate authority core concepts that are integral to the design
and practical usage of `step-ca`.

## Online X.509 Certificate Authority

`step-ca` is an online certificate authority, meaning it runs as a server
on the network and accepts certificate requests.

## Provisioners

Provisioners are methods of proving an entity's identity to the CA prior to getting a new certificate.
The CA needs proof that an entity that is requesting a new certificate is who they say they are.
Once a provisioner authenticates an entity's identity, it then issues the entity a bearer token to submit to the CA, along with a [certificate
signing
request](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html#certificate-signing-requests
'CSR') (CSR), to obtain the new certificate.

The details of how a provisioner interacts with an entity (machines or people) and the CA vary by provisioner type.
Smallstep supports a number of provisioner types including:

- [ACME protocol](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#acme)
- [OAuth/OIDC Single Sign-on](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#oauthoidc-single-sign-on)
- [AWS Instance Identity Documents](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#aws)
- [Google Cloud Instance Identity Tokens](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#gcp)
- [Azure Instance Metadata Service](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#azure) 
- [Kubernetes Service Account Tokens](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#k8ssa-kubernetes-service-account) 
- [SCEP protocol](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#scep)
- [JWT for building custom integrations](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#jwt)

## Active vs. passive revocation

There are two certificate revocation methods: active vs. passive.
Private PKIs like `step-ca` uses passive revocation by default.
Passive revocation doesn't use Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Signing Protocol (OCSP) like the Web PKI you may be familiar with. 

To passively revoke a certificate means to block its renewal at the CA.
This eliminates the additional network request that occurs when using a web PKI because the certificate just expires by itself. 
Unlike active revocation, certificates cannot be immedietely revoked.
Therefore, certificates should have a shorter lifetime to reduce the value of a key that has been exfiltrated.

## Other operational modes

Aside from being an online Certificate Authority, `step-ca` has a couple of non-standard modes of operation:
Registration Authority (RA) mode, and offline mode.

### Registration Authority (RA) mode

`step-ca` can operate in Registration Authority (RA) mode.
An RA is a server that acts as an authentication layer for an upstream signing CA.

RA mode lets you separate certificate request authentication (the RA) from certificate signing operations (the CA).
This operational mode centralizes key management:
a single CA can serve several RAs.

When in RA mode, `step-ca` can peer with three kinds of upstream CA:

- Another `step-ca` server ("StepCAS" mode)
- A [Google CloudCAS](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/) CA
- A [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault) CA

![Example PKI topology with StepCAS RA Mode](/graphics/stepcas-ra-mode.png)

To create an RA-based PKI topology, see our [Registration Authority (RA) Mode](/docs/step-ca/registration-authority-ra-mode) documentation.

### Offline Mode

Sometimes it's useful to access a local CA offline, without running the `step-ca` server.
For this purpose, the `step` CLI can be used in _offline mode_ (with the `--offline` flag).
Offline mode uses the configuration, database, certificates, and keys of an existing `step-ca` installation.

This table shows some of the feature differences between an online `step-ca` server, `step` CLI in offline mode, and the [`step certificate` subcommand](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#run-an-offline-x509-certificate-authority).

### Example: Offline Mode

Let's create a certificate without `step-ca`:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca init --name "Local CA" --provisioner admin --dns localhost --address ":443"
$ step ca certificate --offline foo.smallstep.com foo.crt foo.key
```
