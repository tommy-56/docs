When the [`step ca init`](/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/init) command sets up your PKI, it creates an initial
configuration file for your CA and stores it in `$(step path)/config/ca.json`.

In this document we'll describe how to configure every aspect of `step-ca`. You'll
learn how to configure your CA to:

- bind to a non default address
- generate ACME certificates
- adjust the default lifetime of certificates
- store certificates in memory, on the file system, or in a database
- set the root and intermediate PKI chain that will be used to sign new certificates
- and much more

## Specifying a Configuration File

When you run `step-ca`, you must provide a path to a configuration file
(`ca.json`).
It is the only required argument.
Typically you'd use [`step path`](/docs/step-cli/reference/path) to discover the path to `ca.json`:

```shell-session
$ step-ca $(step path)/config/ca.json
```

The output of [`step path`](/docs/step-cli/reference/path) will vary based on the `$STEPPATH` environment variable, and whether you [use the `step` command with multiple CAs](/docs/step-cli/the-step-command#contexts-working-with-multiple-cas).

For non-interactive use (eg. as a `systemd` service), you can also add a
`--password-file` flag with the name of a file containing the password for the
CA's keys.

## Environment Variables

* `STEPDEBUG` When set to `1`, `step-ca` will provide extra diagnostic information for debugging. This variable can also be used with `step`.

### Configuration Options

- **root**: location of the root certificate on the filesystem. The root certificate is used to mutually authenticate all API clients of the CA.

- **federatedRoots**: location of the federated root certificates on the filesystem. The federated roots are used to authenticate client and servers using TLS certificates from multiple CAs.

- **crt**: location of the intermediate certificate on the filesystem. The intermediate certificate is returned alongside each new certificate, allowing the client to complete the certificate chain.

- **key**: location of the intermediate private key on the filesystem. The intermediate key signs all new certificates generated by the CA.

- **kms**: enables and configures [cryptographic protection](#cryptographic-protection) using cloud key management services or hardware security modules.

  - **type**: required. one of `awskms`, `cloudkms`, `pkcs11`, or `yubikey`

  - **uri**: this field can be used to specify other fields in this section, and its value will take precedence over those values. See [cryptographic protection](#cryptographic-protection) for examples.

  - **region**: for `awskms`, the AWS region

  - **profile**: for `awskms`, the AWS profile

  - **credentialsFile**: for `cloudkms`, the path to a Google Cloud Platform credentials JSON file for a role that can access cloudkms

  - **pin**: for `yubikey`, the PIN of the YubiKey PIV application

- **password**: optionally store the password for decrypting the intermediate private key (this should be the same password you chose during PKI initialization). If the value is not stored in configuration then you will be prompted for it when starting the CA.

- **address**: ex. 127.0.0.1:8080 - address and port on which the CA will bind and respond to requests.

- **dnsNames**: comma separated list of DNS name(s) for the CA.

- **logger**: the default logging format for the CA is _text_. The other option is _json_.

- **ssh**: enables the provisioning of SSH certificates by the CA. Add this section to an existing `ca.json` to enable SSH for an existing CA. SSH keys can be created by running
  `step crypto keypair host.pub host.key` and `step crypto keypair user.pub user.key`.

  - **userKey**: the signing key for user SSH certificates.

  - **hostKey**: the signing key for host SSH certificates.

- **db**: data persistence layer. See [database documentation](#databases) for more info.

  - **type**: badger, bbolt, mysql, or postgresql

  - **dataSource**: string that can be interpreted differently depending on the type of the database. Usually a path to where the data is stored. See the database configuration docs for more info.

  - **database**: name of the database. Used for back-ends that may have multiple databases. e.g. MySQL and PostgreSQL

  - **valueDir**: directory to store the value log in (Badger specific).

- **tls**: settings for negotiating communication with the CA; includes acceptable ciphersuites, min/max TLS version, etc.

- **authority**: controls the request authorization and signature processes.

  - **type**: the type of backing CA service that issues certificates for this step-ca instance. The default is an internal certificate authority service.
  Other options can [turn `step-ca` into a Registration Authority](/docs/step-ca/registration-authority-ra-mode): `stepcas` uses a remote `step-ca` instance as the backend, `cloudcas` uses Google CloudCAS, `vaultcas` uses Hashicorp Vault.

  - **template**: default ASN1DN values for new certificates.

  - **claims**: default validation for requested attributes in the certificate request. Can be overridden by similar claims objects defined by individual provisioners.

    - **minTLSCertDuration**: do not allow certificates with a duration less than this value.

    - **maxTLSCertDuration**: do not allow certificates with a duration greater than this value.

    - **defaultTLSCertDuration**: if no certificate validity period is specified, use this value.

    - **disableRenewal**: do not allow any certificates to be renewed. The default is false.

    - **allowRenewalAfterExpiry**: ☠️  allow expired certificates to be renewed. The default is false. This option adds security risk; proceed with caution and consider alternatives.

    - **minUserSSHCertDuration**: do not allow certificates with a duration less than this value.

    - **maxUserSSHCertDuration**: do not allow certificates with a duration greater than this value.

    - **defaultUserSSHCertDuration**: if no certificate validity period is specified, use this value.

    - **minHostSSHCertDuration**: do not allow certificates with a duration less than this value.

    - **maxHostSSHCertDuration**: do not allow certificates with a duration greater than this value.

    - **defaultHostSSHCertDuration**: if no certificate validity period is specified, use this value.

    - **enableSSHCA**: enable this provisioner to generate SSH Certificates. The default value is false.

  - **disableIssuedAtCheck**: ☠️  disable a check verifying that provisioning tokens must be issued after the CA has booted. This claim is one prevention
 against token reuse. The default value is false. Do not change this unless you know what you are doing.

  - **provisioners**: list of provisioners. Each provisioner has a name, associated authentication attributes, and an optional claims attribute that will override any values set in the global claims directly underneath authority. The [`step ca provisioner`](/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/provisioner) command group can be used to add, modify, and remove provisioners. See the [provisioner documentation](/docs/step-ca/provisioners) for details.

    - **claims**: Each provisioner can define an optional `claims` attribute. The settings in this attribute override any settings in the global `claims` attribute in the authority configuration. See the authority's **claims** section above for a complete list of options.

    - **options**: Each provisioner can define an optional `options` attribute. This attribute allows an operator to set templates that will be applied to all X.509 or SSH certificates generated using the provisioner. See the [templates documentation](/docs/step-ca/templates) for details.

  - **password**: ☠️  plain text password for starting the CA. Used to decrypt the intermediate private key. 

    <Alert severity="warning">
      <div> 
        We do not recommend storing the password plain text in your <Code>ca.json</Code>. 
        The recommended option is to use the <Code>--password-file</Code> flag when

## Provisioners

Provisioners are people or entities that are registered with the certificate authority and 
authorized to issue certificates. Visit the [`step-ca` provisioners](/docs/step-ca/provisioners) page to learn about the 
different provisioners, their target use cases, and how to add, remove, and configure them.

## Templates

People use private CAs for all sorts of things, in many different contexts:
web apps, mobile apps, code signing, cloud VM instances, SSH, IoT devices, etc.
So `step-ca` must be flexible enough to handle a wide variety of flows.

X.509 and SSH certificate templates open up these possibilities.
With certificate templates, you can do things like:

- Add custom SANs or extensions to X.509 certificates
- Make longer certificate chains, with multiple intermediate CAs
- Use SSH `force-command` or `source-address` extensions
- Add conditionals around a certificate's parameters, and fail if they are not met

Visit the [`step-ca` templates](/docs/step-ca/templates) page to learn how to use templates.

## Databases

`step-ca` uses a simple key-value interface over popular database
implementations to store persistent certificate management meta-data. Our
recommended default database implementation is nosql-Badger, a NoSQL interface
over the popular [Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) database. As a
first pass, the database layer will store every certificate (along with
        metadata surrounding the provisioning of the certificate) and
revocation data that will be used to enforce passive revocation.

Configuring `step-ca` to use a database is as simple as adding a top-level `db`
stanza to your `ca.json` file. Below users can find documentation and examples
for supported databases:

- [Badger](#badger)
- [BoltDB](#boltdb)
- [MySQL](#mysql)
- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)

### Badger

```json
{
  ...
  "db": {
    "type": "badger",
    "dataSource": "./.step/db",
    "valueDir": "./.step/valuedb"
    "badgerFileLoadingMode": "MemoryMap"
  },
  ...
},
```

**Options**

- `type`

  - **badger**: currently refers to Badger V1. However, as Badger V1 is deprecated, this will refer to Badger V2 starting with a the next major version release.
  - **badgerV1**: explicitly select Badger V1.
  - **badgerV2**: explicitly select Badger V2. Anyone looking to use Badger V2 will need to set it explicitly until it becomes the default.

- `dataSource`: path, database directory.
- `valueDir` [optional]: path, value directory, only if different from dataSource.
- `badgerFileLoadingMode` [optional]: can be set to FileIO (instead of the default MemoryMap) to avoid memory-mapping log files. This can be useful in environments with low RAM. Make sure to use badgerV2 as the database type if using this option.
  - **MemoryMap**: default.
  - **FileIO**: This can be useful in environments with low RAM.

### BoltDB

```json
{
  ...
  "db": {
    "type": "bbolt",
    "dataSource": "./stepdb"
  },
  ...
}
```

**Options**

- `type`: **bbolt**
- `dataSource`: path, database directory.

### MySQL

```json
{
  ...
  "db": {
    "type": "mysql",
    "dataSource": "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/",
    "database": "myDBName"
  },
  ...
},
```

**Options**

- `type`: **mysql**
- `dataSource`: path, database directory.

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    Extra parameters can be passed in the mysql dataSource name as follows: <Code>"dataSource": "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/myDBName?tls=true"</Code>.
  </div>
</Alert>

### PostgreSQL

```json
{
  ...
  "db": {
    "type": "postgresql",
    "dataSource": "postgresql://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/",
    "database": "myDBName"
  },
  ...
},
```

#### Options

- `type`: **postgresql**
- `dataSource`: a PostgreSQL DSN.
- `database`: database name. Takes precedence over name in the DSN if provided.

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    Extra parameters can be passed in the PostgreSQL dataSource name as follows: <Code>"dataSource": "postgresql://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/myDBName?connect_timeout=10"</Code>.
  </div>
</Alert>

#### Use TLS with PostgreSQL

The PostgreSQL DSN can be used to configure TLS settings for connecting to the server.
An example database configuration that enables TLS server hostname verification is shown below:

```json
{
  ...
  "db": {
    "type": "postgresql",
    "dataSource": "postgresql://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/dbname?sslmode=verify-full",
  },
  ...
},
```

The database driver will look for a file with root CAs to trust in `$HOME/.postgresql/root.crt`, but will use the system CA trust store if that file is not found.
Similarly, `$HOME/.postgresql/postgresql.crt` and the corresponding `$HOME/.postgresql/postgresql.key` will be used for mutual TLS authentication if these files exist and if the server requests a client certificate.
It is also possible to override the locations for these files by providing them in the DSN:

```json
{
  ...
  "db": {
    "type": "postgresql",
    "dataSource": "postgresql://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/dbname?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/path/to/roots.pem&sslcert=/path/to/client.pem&sslkey=/path/to/client.key",
  },
  ...
},
```

The behavior of the PostgreSQL database driver mimics that of `libpq` and also encompasses handling of other default settings and environment variables.
More info about TLS options and the DSN query parameters for `libpq` can be found at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html.

### Schema

As the interface is a key-value store, the schema is very simple. We support tables, keys, and values. An entry in the database is a `[]byte value` that is indexed by `[]byte table` and `[]byte key`.

### Exporting Data

At this time `step-ca` does not have any API or interface for easily exporting data. Because the data is stored in a `noSQL` like manner, it is difficult to explore the data even when using a SQL backend like MySQL. We do have [a scripted example for accessing the DB][scripted-export-db] to give users a jumping off point for writing their own reporting and logging tools.

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    Note that some DBs, like Badger and BoltDB, cannot have multiple processes accessing them simultaneously. You'll need to 
    stop the <Code>step-ca</Code> process in order to run a export script against those DBs.
  </div>
</Alert>

[scripted-export-db]: https://gist.github.com/dopey/89ec20f22c66c1333bf38c9b19b89758

## Cryptographic Protection

By default, `step-ca` stores its signing keys encrypted on disk, on the CA.
Some use cases may require more advanced cryptographic protection.
For protection of you signing keys,
`step-ca` integrates with [Google Cloud KMS](#google-cloud-kms),
[AWS KMS](#aws-kms),
[Azure Key Vault](#azure-key-vault), 
[YubiKey PIV](#yubikey-piv),
and [PKCS #11 hardware security modules (HSMs)](#pkcs-11).

For a complete, end-to-end tutorial using YubiKeys,
see our blog post [Build a Tiny Certificate Authority For Your Homelab](https://smallstep.com/blog/build-a-tiny-ca-with-raspberry-pi-yubikey/).

### Google Cloud KMS

[Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs) is Google's cloud-hosted KMS that allows you to store the cryptographic keys and sign certificates using their infrastructure. Cloud KMS supports two different protection levels: `SOFTWARE` and `HSM`.

To configure Cloud KMS in your certificate authority, add the `kms` object to your `ca.json` file and replace the property `key` with the Cloud KMS key name of your intermediate key:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "projects/<project-id>/locations/global/keyRings/<ring-id>/cryptoKeys/<key-id>/cryptoKeyVersions/<version-number>",
    "kms": {
        "type": "cloudkms",
        "uri": "cloudkms:credentials-file=/path/to/kms-credentials.json"
    }
}
```

In a similar way for SSH certificates, the SSH keys must be Cloud KMS names:

```json nocopy
{
    "ssh": {
        "hostKey": "projects/<project-id>/locations/global/keyRings/<ring-id>/cryptoKeys/<key-id>/cryptoKeyVersions/<version-number>",
        "userKey": "projects/<project-id>/locations/global/keyRings/<ring-id>/cryptoKeys/<key-id>/cryptoKeyVersions/<version-number>"
    }
}
```

Currently, `step` does not provide an automatic way to initialize the public key infrastructure (PKI) using Cloud KMS. Still, an experimental tool named `step-cloudkms-init` addresses this use case. This tool generates the public certificates `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` for inclusion in `ca.json` and prints the intermediate key name for use in the `key` property. In a future release, this tool will be integrated into `step`.

To use `step-cloudkms-init`, install it from the [latest `step-ca` release tarball](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/releases), enable Cloud KMS in your project, and run:

```shell nocopy
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
$ step-cloudkms-init --project your-project-id --ssh
Creating PKI ...
✔ Root Key: projects/your-project-id/locations/global/keyRings/pki/cryptoKeys/root/cryptoKeyVersions/1
✔ Root Certificate: root_ca.crt
✔ Intermediate Key: projects/your-project-id/locations/global/keyRings/pki/cryptoKeys/intermediate/cryptoKeyVersions/1
✔ Intermediate Certificate: intermediate_ca.crt

Creating SSH Keys ...
✔ SSH User Public Key: ssh_user_ca_key.pub
✔ SSH User Private Key: projects/your-project-id/locations/global/keyRings/pki/cryptoKeys/ssh-user-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1
✔ SSH Host Public Key: ssh_host_ca_key.pub
✔ SSH Host Private Key: projects/your-project-id/locations/global/keyRings/pki/cryptoKeys/ssh-host-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1
```

By default, the keys are generated using the `SOFTWARE` protection level. Add the flag `---protection-level HSM` to use a Hardware Security Module (HSM).

Run the `step-cloudkms-init --help` command for more options.

### Azure Key Vault

[Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/#product-overview) is Microsoft's managed key management service.

#### Authentication

When using Azure Key Vault with `step-ca`, you will first need to authenticate to Azure.
Authentication to Azure is handled via environment variables;
we recommend using either [file-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) via the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable,
or [creating a service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli)
and setting the `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` variables when starting `step-ca`.
See Option 1 under [Authentication Methods for Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authentication?tabs=bash#-option-1-define-environment-variables) for examples of authentication methods and environment variables.

For local development and testing, Azure CLI credentials will be used if no authentication environment variables are set.

#### Initialize a PKI

To initialize a PKI backed by Azure Key Vault, start by authenticating to Azure using one of the above approaches.
Set the environment variables necessary for authentication to your tenant.

Then, run:

```bash
$ step ca init --kms azurekms
```

You will be walked through the process of creating root and intermediate CA signing keys in Key Vault, and configuring the CA to use them.
If you're creating an SSH CA, SSH host and user CA keys will be created in Key Vault as well.

#### Manual Configuration

To configure an existing CA for Azure Key Vault, or to import an existing Azure Key Vault signing key, add the `kms` object to your `ca.json`, and replace the `key` properties with the key name, vault name, and version of your intermediate (signing) key in Azure Key Vault:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "azurekms:name=intermediate-ca-key;vault=example-vault-0?version=15faf8b8b80d4f1ead067c6383a38b8f&hsm=true",
    "kms": {
        "type": "azurekms"
    }
}
```

* In the `key` URI, the `name` and `vault` refer to the key name and vault name of your intermediate key in Azure Key Vault.
* In the `key` URI, the `version` is the version of the Azure Key Vault key name. Though it is optional, we recommend setting this value explicitly. If omitted, the latest version will be used.
* In the `key` URI, the optional `hsm` property can be set to `true` if HSM protection is desired. This is only used when the key is being created by `step-ca`. The default is to use software-protected (non-HSM-backed) keys. See Key Vault's [About Keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys) page for more details.
* In `kms`, an optional `uri` property can be added to provide client credentials (eg. `azurekms:client-id=fooo;client-secret=bar;tenant-id=9de53416-4431-4181-7a8b-23af3EXAMPLE`) instead of using the environment variables described above.

### AWS KMS

[AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) is Amazon's managed encryption and key management service. It creates and stores the cryptographic keys and uses AWS infrastructure for signing operations. Amazon KMS operations are always backed by HSMs.

To configure AWS KMS in your certificate authority, add the `kms` object to `ca.json` and replace the `key` property with the AWS KMS key name of your intermediate key:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "awskms:key-id=f879f239-feb6-4596-9ed2-b1606277c7fe",
    "kms": {
        "type": "awskms",
        "uri": "awskms:region=us-west-2;profile=foo;credentials-file=/path/to/credentials"
    }
}
```

By default, `step-ca` uses the credentials stored in `~/.aws/credentials`. Use the `credentials-file` option to override. The `region` and `profile` options specify the AWS region and configuration profiles respectively. These options can also be configured using environment variables as described in the [AWS SDK for Go session documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/).

In similar manner, to configure SSH certificate signing, replace the SSH keys with the keys from AWS KMS:

```json nocopy
{
    "ssh": {
        "hostKey": "awskms:key-id=d48e502a-09bc-4bf7-9af8-ae1bccedc931",
        "userKey": "awskms:key-id=cf28e942-1e10-4a08-b84c-5359af1b5f12"
    }
}
```

`step-ca` can also accept just the Amazon Key ID or the ARN as key options, but using the format based on the [RFC7512](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7512) will allow more flexibility for future `step` releases.

Currently, `step` does not provide an automatic way to initialize the public key infrastructure (PKI) using AWS KMS, but an experimental tool named `step-awskms-init` addresses this use case. This tool generates the public certificates `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` for inclusion in `ca.json` and prints the intermediate key name for use in the `key` property. In a future release, this tool will be integrated into `step`.

To use `step-awskms-init`, make sure to [configure your environment using `aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html), install `step-awskms-init` from the [latest `step-ca` release tarball](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/releases), and run:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step-awskms-init --ssh --region us-east-1">{`$ step-awskms-init --ssh --region us-east-1

The `--region` parameter is only required if your AWS configuration does not define a region.

Run the `step-awskms-init --help` command for more options.

### YubiKey PIV

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    <strong>This feature is not enabled by default</strong><br />
    To enable support, you will need to build <code>step-ca</code> yourself, using CGO support.<br />
    See <a href="https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-step-ca-using-cgo">Building From Source Using CGO</a>. 
  </div>
</Alert>

You can leverage a hardware [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/)—and the [YubiKey PIV application](https://www.yubico.com/authentication-standards/smart-card/)—to store your CA keys and sign TLS certificates.

#### Prerequisites and Caveats
* To enable YubiKey support in `step-ca`, you must follow our [Instructions for building from source using CGO](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-step-ca-using-cgo)
* You will need a YubiKey that supports the PIV application: YubiKey 5 NFC, YubiKey 5 Nano, YubiKey 5C, or YubiKey 5C Nano
* [Certificate slots](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/Certificate_slots.html) 9a, 9c, 9d, 9e, and 82-95 are supported
* You can use the YubiKey for X.509 and SSH CAs; however, the `step-yubikey-init` utility only supports X.509 at this time. For SSH support, you must manually generate and configure SSH CA keys on the YubiKey.

The initialization of the public key infrastructure (PKI) for YubiKeys is not currently integrated into `step`, but an experimental tool named `step-yubikey-init` addresses this use case. In a future release, this tool will be integrated into `step`.

To configure your YubiKey, install `step-yubikey-init` from the [latest `step-ca` release tarball](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/releases) and run:

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="step-yubikey-init"
  >{`$ step-yubikey-init
 
What is the YubiKey PIN?:
Creating PKI ...
✔ Root Key: yubikey:slot-id=9a
✔ Root Certificate: root_ca.crt
✔ Intermediate Key: yubikey:slot-id=9c
✔ Intermediate Certificate: intermediate_ca.crt`}</CodeBlock>

Run the `step-yubikey-init --help` command for more options.

Finally, to enable it in `ca.json`, point the `root` and `crt` options to the generated certificates, replace the `key` option with the YubiKey URI generated in the previous part, and configure the `kms` option with the appropriate `type` and `pin`.

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/path/to/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/path/to/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "yubikey:slot-id=9c",
    "kms": {
        "type": "yubikey",
        "uri": "yubikey:management-key=01020304...?pin-value=123456"
    }
}
```

A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a specialized piece of hardware that is designed to generate and store private keys, and sign messages using those keys.
The private keys on an HSM cannot be exported from the device.
One can only run signing operations using the key.
This is an excellent way to protect private keys for a Certificate Authority,
which in normal operation simply needs to be able to sign Certificate Signing Requests.
 
[Public-Key Cryptography Standards #11 (PKCS #11)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11) is the most common platform-independent API used to access HSM hardware.
It's supported by most HSM hardware, like Yubico's [YubiHSM2](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubihsm-2/), and the [Nitrokey HSM 2](https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nk-hsm-2-nitrokey-hsm-2-7).
There's also a software-based "HSM," [SoftHSMv2](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2), which offers a PKCS #11 interface without the hardware.
Finally, you can use PKCS#11 with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chip on Linux. This requires the [libtpm2_pkcs11.so](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-pkcs11) library.

#### 0. Before you begin

Your HSM or TPM2 may need to be prepared before you can initialize a PKI on it.
Preparation steps depend on the device and are beyond the scope of this documentation.
For example,

- With YubiHSM2, you will need to create an authentication key with appropriate capabiliites.
- With TPM2, you will need to initialize the TPM and create a PKCS#11 token on it.

You'll also want to consider how you will backup and restore your CA keys, for offline storage.

#### 1. Initialize your PKI using the `step-pkcs11-init` tool.

The `step-pkcs11-init` tool will create or import CA keys and/or certificates onto your HSM, for use with `step-ca`.
It is configured to work with the YubiHSM2 by default, but you can provide a different PKCS #11 URI by using the `--kms` flag.

Here are some examples of PKCS #11 URIs for accessing various devices in Linux:

HSM              | URI format
---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YubiHSM2         | `pkcs11:module-path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/yubihsm_pkcs11.so;token=YubiHSM`
AWS CloudHSM     | `pkcs11:module-path=/opt/cloudhsm/lib/libcloudhsm_pkcs11.so;token=cavium?pin-value=$HSM_USER:$HSM_PASSWORD`
SoftHSM          | `pkcs11:module-path=/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so;token=token1?pin-value=$HSM_PASSWORD`
nCipher nShield  | `pkcs11:module-path=/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so;token=rjk?pin-source=/etc/step-ca/hsm-pin.txt`
TPM2             | `pkcs11:module-path=/usr/local/lib/libtpm2_pkcs11.so;token=step-ca?pin-value=$HSM_PASSWORD`

You'll need to substitute `$HSM_USER` and `$HSM_PASSWORD` with your own values.

In this URI,
* `module-path` points to your PKCS #11 `.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib` library file,
* `token` is the label (`CKA_LABEL`) of the HSM you're using,
* `pin-value` contains hardcoded HSM credentials. It may be a PIN, username and password, password, or a filename. The YubiHSM2 is special in that the PIN value is the concatenation of the four-digit authorization key ID (eg. `0001`) and the PIN.
* Or, `pin-source` is a filename containing HSM credentials.

Once the utility creates your PKI, it will output a few paths for your keys and certificates before exiting.
You'll need these for step 2.

#### 2. Configure the CA to use PKCS #11

One you've created your PKI on the HSM using `step-pkcs11-init`, you'll need to configure `step-ca` to use the HSM.

Start with a standard CA configuration, created using [`step ca init`](/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/init) or [`step ca init --ssh`](/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/init).

Now open up `.step/config/ca.json` in an editor.
You'll want the top of the file to reference the HSM key paths provided by the `step-pkcs11-init` utility.

For this, you'll need to change the `key` and `ssh` values to match the `pkcs11:` URIs above. These are the values you need to change:

```json
{
        ...
        "key": "pkcs11:id=7331;object=intermediate-key",
        "ssh": {
                "hostKey": "pkcs11:id=7332;object=ssh-host-key",
                "userKey": "pkcs11:id=7333;object=ssh-user-key"
        },
        ...
}
```

You'll also need to add a `kms` top-level object that contains your `pkcs11` module URI:

```json
{
  ...
  "kms": {
    "type": "pkcs11",
    "uri": "pkcs11:module-path=/opt/cloudhsm/lib/libcloudhsm_pkcs11.so;token=cavium?pin-value=step_ca:RiFJrg93Tn_EXAMPLE"
  },
  ...
}
```
